## Why the Blog You Guy?

I started this blog in cunjunction with the formation of the USC Computer Music Club. Were not an official club...yet. I'm using this blog as a sort of daily-log -- documenting my adventures in music and programming. I hope that by sharing my knowldege, I can accumulate some knowledge-karma or maybe find a nice internet girlfriend (Tracy Spiridakos if you're reading this call me).

If you're interest in computer music and want to get in touch with the usc comp-music comunity, you can start by visiting our gibhub page [here](https://github.com/clay-to-n/USComputerMusic).

## A Bit About Me

I'm Andrew, a USC Studio/Jazz Guitar BA. These days I don't play much guitar. I discovered Music production and sound design a few years ago and it took over my life. 

Warning: self-promotion below...

I offer my services as a producer/ sound engineer/ sound designer/ composer for a modest fee. Check out this commercial I did for West Coast Ind. this summer [here](http://www.westcoastindustries.com/). The track is called Big Chitty Lights and I wrote/ produced it at my home studio in Orange County, Ca. If you need a personalized theme song for you're ringtone please get in touch. Better yet-- if you have a videogame, tv series, advertisement, or album that could benefit from a creative musical solution, thats exactly what I do (I set myself up for that) so do us both a favor and get in touch.

I'm getting really into programming latley, its opening up a new world of creative controll in music composition and production. Its a great time to use your brain and an even better time to appreciate music. I'll be writing about my own programming-music projects here and I'm always interested in hearing about others.
